# State store lite

A lightweight state management system based on redux with a focus towards local state and single purpose actions.

I create this to aid my experimental projects where the unidirectional flow is disireable but the whole action and reducer setup is overkill and verbose.

## Main Goals.
1. Create a redux like store where the actions and reducer are generated by a simple function
2. Keep the reducer flow of returning new state
3. Must be consumable by [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/)
4. Must be consumable by browser modules (using unpkg.com)
5. Must be consumable by webpack

## Usage
Coming soon after publication

## Insperations
1. [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
2. [Redux Actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions)
